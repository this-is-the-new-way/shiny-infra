## üèóÔ∏è Part 1: Architecture Overview (8 minutes)

### **Visual Architecture Walkthrough**
```
"Let me start with the overall architecture..."
```

#### **Show**: `ARCHITECTURE_ENTRY_POINTS.md`
- **System Architecture Diagram**
- **Multi-Environment Isolation**
- **Data Flow Patterns**

#### **Navigate to**: `main.tf`
```terraform
# Point to these key sections:
locals {
  name_prefix = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}"
  common_tags = merge({
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
  }, var.additional_tags)
}
```

**Talking Points**:
- "Here's the main orchestration layer..."
- "Notice how we use locals for consistent naming..."
- "Each environment gets its own prefix and tags..."

#### **Show Module Structure**
```bash
# In terminal:
tree modules/
```

**Talking Points**:
- "The architecture is modular and reusable..."
- "Each module has a single responsibility..."
- "This allows for easy testing and maintenance..."

## üîß Part 2: Environment Isolation Deep Dive (8 minutes)

### **Show Environment Configuration**
#### **Navigate to**: `variables.tf`
```terraform
# Point to environment validation:
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name (dev, qa, prod)"
  type        = string
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "qa", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be one of: dev, qa, prod."
  }
}
```

**Talking Points**:
- "Environment validation prevents deployment mistakes..."
- "We use Terraform's built-in validation..."

#### **Compare Environment Files**
```bash
# Show side-by-side comparison:

- "Production uses appropriate resources (0.5 vCPU, 1 GB)..."
- "NAT Gateway disabled in dev/qa for cost savings..."

---

## üîß Interactive Q&A Session (10 minutes)

### **Potential Questions & Answers**

#### **Q: "How do you handle database connections?"**
**A**: "The security module includes database security groups. We'd typically use RDS with separate instances per environment, connecting through environment variables or secrets manager."

#### **Q: "What about disaster recovery?"**
**A**: "The infrastructure is multi-AZ by design. For DR, we'd implement cross-region replication of the ECR repository and database snapshots."

#### **Q: "How do you manage secrets?"**
**A**: "AWS Secrets Manager integration is built into the application module. Secrets are referenced by ARN and injected at runtime."

#### **Q: "What about SSL/TLS?"**
**A**: "The ALB module supports HTTPS listeners. We'd use ACM for certificate management and configure domain routing."

#### **Q: "How do you handle rollbacks?"**
**A**: "ECS supports blue-green deployments. Terraform state allows infrastructure rollbacks. We'd implement automated rollback triggers based on health checks."
