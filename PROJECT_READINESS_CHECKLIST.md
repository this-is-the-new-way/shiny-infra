## üé™ Interview Scenarios & Responses

### **Scenario 1: "How would you add a database to this architecture?"**
**Response**: "I'd add an RDS module with separate instances per environment, integrate with the security module for database security groups, and use Secrets Manager for credentials. The application module already supports secrets injection."

### **Scenario 2: "What if we need to support multiple regions?"**
**Response**: "The modular architecture makes this straightforward. I'd create region-specific provider configurations, replicate the ECR repository, and implement cross-region backup strategies for stateful components."

### **Scenario 3: "How do you handle secrets in this setup?"**
**Response**: "The application module includes AWS Secrets Manager integration. Secrets are referenced by ARN and injected at runtime. The IAM roles include the necessary permissions for secrets access."

### **Scenario 4: "What about SSL/TLS and custom domains?"**
**Response**: "The ALB module supports HTTPS listeners. I'd integrate with AWS Certificate Manager for SSL certificates and Route 53 for domain management. The infrastructure supports this without architectural changes."
